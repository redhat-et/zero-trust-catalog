* zero-trust-catalog

A project to define an OSCAL catalog of controls for Zero Trust and related component models for
Red Hat products.

The OSCAL architecture is described in https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/resources/concepts/layer/.

This project uses [[https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf][NIST SP 800-207 - Zero Trust Architecture]] as the definition of a desired Zero
Trust architectural state. The controls defined in [[https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf][NIST SP 800-53 rev5]] and
[[https://github.com/cloud-native-security-controls/controls-catalog][Cloud Native Security Controls]] are used as a basis and cross-referenced with the architectural
tenets described in NIST SP 800-207.

The catalog of controls in this project is derived from the NIST maintained OSCAL content in:
https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content.
