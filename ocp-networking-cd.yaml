                  remarks: |
                    Primary Capability: federated identity access management systems may
                    integrate with RH Single Sign-On or RHEL IDM via programmatic APIs or LDAP
                    to retrieve user attributes for policy and access rule adjustments.Note: Red
                    Hat OCP includes RH SSO which is required to provide indicated primary
                    capability.

                  value: 1.7 Least Privileged Access
                  remarks: |
                    Primary Capability: Red Hat Openshift can enforce least privilege access for
                    hosted workloads, as determined by its own RBAC polciies or external
                    policies defined and determined by RH SSO or RH SSO, via mutliple
                    techniques. Use of SDN ingress and egress points allows enforcement of
                    general policies such as a deny-by-default for unauthorized users by
                    blocking all access to tenant workloads. RH Appliation Foundations 3Scale
                    API management can block acess for specific workloads by policy. RH OSSM can
                    automate the enplacement and configuration of access enforcement proxies
                    that can block access to fine grained microservices. Each of these
                    techniques are implemented via custom configuration or tailoring ot these
                    components, which may be automated via RH OCP or RH AAP to maintain
                    consistent least privilege access for all workloads.Secondary Capability:
                    Red Hat Openshift provides standard default workload roles and attributes
                    including rroles standard and privileged actions. Granted default roles may
                    be customized and unprivileged changes to these roles locked out.Primary
                    Capability: all Red Hat products deny access by default and require
                    authentication and authorization based on user/role attributes. Workloads
                    hosted on Red Hat OpenShift can readily be connected to inherent SAML/OIDC
                    SSO services for access control.

                  value: 2.4 Remote Access
                  remarks: |
                    Primary Capability: Red Hat Openshift allows configuration of networks to a
                    least privilege baseline via mulitple techniques. RH OCP SDN network ingress
                    and egress may be individually configured to allow inbound and outbound
                    access from specifc users, networks, or other factors. Network Policies may
                    be configured to provide firewall-like allow and deny rules to specific
                    addresses, ports, and services on the SDN.Primary Capability: Red Hat
                    Ansible provides enterprise automation to support Configuration as Code,
                    monitor configuration drift and set/maintain access baselines across a wide
                    variety of enforcement points and products, both within and outside the Red
                    Hat portfolio.Partial / Integration Capability: Red Hat ACS may be used to
                    automate the asssessment of network policies against actual measured usage
                    to determine the applicable least privilege baseline and automate the
                    application of the baseline.

                  remarks: |
                    Primary Capability: A Red Hat OpenShift environment defines and uttilizes a
                    software defined network to route traffic between hosted workloads. This SDN
                    is managed by OpenShift that acts as the control plane, and instruments
                    changes against the component nodes and network configuration objects within
                    the cluster. OpenShift offers a programmatic interface and REST APIs for
                    instrumentation of the SDN and other OpenShift functions.Primary Capability:
                    Within the context of Red Hat OpenShift, as described above, OpenShift acts
                    as the centralized manager for the SDN data plane.Primary Capability: Within
                    a Red Hat OpenShift environment, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security
                    continously monitors ingress, egress, and internal network traffic patterns
                    and containerized workload compliance/risk and enforces network policies for
                    positive control over application traffic.

                  value: 5.4 Micro Segmentation
                  remarks: |
                    Primary Capability: Red Hat OpenShift defines very specific network access
                    controls between the workloads it hosts. Applications are contstrained to
                    their namespaces/projects, OpenShift Service Mesh enforces mTLS and other
                    controls between workloads, and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security enforces
                    network poliicies between workloads. All together, these capabiilites
                    provide very fine-grained network microsegmentation within an OpenShift
                    application environment.Primary Capability: Red Hat OpenShift inherently
                    automates the configuration and dynamism of network policies within itself,
                    and exposes these functions via API. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
                    supports automated configuration and policy deployment for a wide variety of
                    platforms across the enterprise as well.Primary Capability: Red Hat
                    OpenShift and Red Hat Enterprise Linux support SELinux for host-based
                    process segmentation at the kernel level based on user/group atrributes.
