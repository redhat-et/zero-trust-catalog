      Resource monitoring should cover all categories of resources, including
      those that are enterprise-owned, not managed by the enterprise, and
      personally owned.
  - id: mon-cna-req-2
    title: >-
      Monitoring should cover application targets (e.g., containers),
      application infrastructure elements (e.g., control plane elements of a
      service mesh), and data plane elements (e.g., sidecar proxies).
  - id: mon-cna-req-3
    title: >-
      Monitoring should cover every user access request and the subsequent
      series of service calls needed to complete the user request as in
      microservices-based applications.
  - id: mon-cna-req-4
    title: >-
      Monitoring should cover changes to data in enterprise directories to
      ensure that all changes to directory entries are associated with valid
      requests and valid transactions for carrying out the change requests.
  - id: mon-data-use-1
    title: >-
      Access enforcement in the context of identity-tier policies in ZTA should
      be based on access decisions that rely on assigned permissions as well as
      the contextual information about each connection or access request.

    title: >-
      The telemetry data generated from monitoring activity should be used in
      the following ways:

      + To fine-tune access rights data, such as granting, revoking, and
        restricting access [6]

      + To implement step-up authentication by asking for more information from
        users or resorting to a stronger form of authentication (e.g.,
        phishing-resistant MFA). This verification establishes trust in them and
        grants permission to proceed with authorization after their identity is
        verified.
